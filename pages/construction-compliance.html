            <h2>Legal Requirements for Construction Compliance in South Africa</h2>
            <p>
                The <strong>Occupational Health and Safety Act, 1993 (Act No. 85 of 1993)</strong>, and the <strong>Construction Regulations, 2014</strong>, establish a legal framework to ensure safety on construction sites in South Africa. Both clients (project owners) and contractors have specific duties to protect workers, visitors, and the public.
            </p>
            <h3>Client Responsibilities</h3>
            <p>
                Clients are obligated under <strong>Section 8(2)(e) of the OHS Act</strong> to ensure that contractors are competent and that the site is safe. The Construction Regulations further specify:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>CR 5(1)(a)</strong>: Prepare a health and safety specification outlining safety requirements for the project.</li>
                <li><strong>CR 5(1)(b)</strong>: Submit a Notification of Construction Work (Annexure 2) to the Department of Labour before work begins.</li>
                <li><strong>CR 5(1)(k)</strong>: Appoint a competent principal contractor to manage safety on-site.</li>
                <li><strong>CR 5(1)(f)</strong>: Ensure the contractor complies with the OHS Act and regulations throughout the project.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Contractor Responsibilities</h3>
            <p>
                Contractors must comply with <strong>Section 9 of the OHS Act</strong>, ensuring their activities do not endanger others. The Construction Regulations require contractors to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>CR 5(1)(b)</strong>: Develop a health and safety plan based on the clientâ€™s specification.</li>
                <li><strong>CR 9</strong>: Conduct risk assessments to identify and mitigate
