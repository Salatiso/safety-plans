The enduring Legacy of NOSA and SAMTRAC
The South African Mining and Training Academy (SAMTRAC), introduced by the National Occupational Safety Association (NOSA) in 1951, has been pivotal in South Africa's occupational health and safety (OHS) training. Initially a two-week course focusing on risk assessment and legal compliance, SAMTRAC has evolved over the years, now offering an expanded curriculum and gaining accreditation from multiple industry bodies. Priced between R15,000 to R25,000, SAMTRAC has not only remained popular within South Africa but has also gained recognition in other African countries. Despite competition from international courses like NEBOSH, SAMTRAC continues to be a preferred choice for those pursuing a career in OHS in South Africa.
