Updated Functional Specification: safetyfirst.help - Construction H&S Compliance Platform
1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose of the Website
The "safetyfirst.help" platform automates and streamlines the complex processes involved in compiling, managing, and tracking essential occupational health and safety (OHS) documentation for construction projects within South Africa. Its core objective is to facilitate compliance with the governing legislative framework, primarily the Occupational Health and Safety Act No. 85 of 1993 (OHSA), the Compensation for Occupational Injuries and Diseases Act No. 130 of 1993 (COIDA), and the specific requirements of the Construction Regulations, 2014. The platform simplifies the creation and maintenance of critical documents such as Health and Safety Specifications, Health and Safety Plans, Health and Safety Files, Baseline Risk Assessments, COIDA registration and compliance records, Department of Employment and Labour (DoL) notifications, statutory appointments, and mandatary agreements. By providing structured workflows and document templates, "safetyfirst.help" reduces the administrative burden and potential for non-compliance for all key stakeholders involved in construction projects, namely Clients, Contractors (both Principal Contractors and Sub-contractors), and registered Health & Safety Professionals.
The platform is designed to be accessible to non-technical users (e.g., small contractors, clients with limited OHS expertise) while remaining valuable for technical OHS specialists. It includes educational components, such as legal extracts, to inform users of their obligations under South African law, ensuring compliance is both functional and informative.
1.2 Objective of this Specification
This document serves as the formal functional specification for the "safetyfirst.help" website, updated to reflect the current implementation as of the latest changes. Its objective is to provide the development team with a comprehensive, technically detailed, and legally grounded blueprint for the platform. It defines user roles, system features, data structures, and non-functional aspects such as security, usability, and user independence. This specification ensures that the platform accurately reflects the duties, responsibilities, and interactions mandated by South African construction OHS law, delivering a robust and compliant software solution that empowers users to manage their projects independently.
1.3 Scope of this Specification
The scope encompasses the functional requirements for the "safetyfirst.help" platform, derived from a detailed analysis of the OHSA, COIDA, the Construction Regulations 2014, and SACPCMP guidelines. It details functionalities for each primary user role: Client, Contractor (Principal and Sub-contractor), and H&S Professional (Agent, Manager, Officer). Core system functionalities include user management, project setup, document generation using legally compliant templates, document storage and version control, workflow management for approvals and notifications, risk assessment tools, appointment tracking, compliance status monitoring, and data handling procedures. The specification now includes educational features (e.g., legal obligation carousels, inline legal notes), temporary data storage for non-logged-in users, and user-driven project management to minimize administrative intervention. While this document outlines operational logic and legal compliance, it excludes detailed UI/UX design mockups.

3. User Roles, Permissions, and Workflow
3.1 Definition of Roles
(Updated to reflect implementation details)
The platform supports distinct user roles reflecting key players in a construction project, each with specific responsibilities mandated by law:
Client: The entity commissioning the construction work. Responsible for initiating the H&S process by preparing the BRA, H&S Specification, appointing a Principal Contractor, verifying COIDA status, approving the H&S Plan, and conducting periodic audits. Clients can also appoint an Agent to manage these duties.
Principal Contractor (PC): The employer appointed by the Client to manage the overall construction site. Responsible for developing and implementing the H&S Plan, maintaining the H&S File, appointing competent management (e.g., Construction Manager, CHSO), managing sub-contractors, conducting HIRAs, and ensuring site safety.
Contractor (Sub-contractor): An employer appointed by the PC or another contractor. Must develop their own H&S Plan, contribute to the H&S File, comply with PC directives, ensure COIDA compliance, and manage their operations’ safety. The current implementation treats Contractors as PCs for simplicity, with sub-contractor management planned for future updates.
H&S Professional (Agent/Manager/Officer): Provides specialized H&S expertise and requires specific competencies, often SACPCMP registration.
Agent (PrCHSA): Appointed by the Client, typically for permit-required projects. Acts as the Client’s representative, managing H&S compliance.
Manager (CHSM): Appointed by the Contractor to manage H&S systems planning and implementation.
Officer (CHSO): Appointed by the Contractor to assist with practical H&S implementation and monitoring on-site.
Implementation Update: H&S Professionals can perform all Client and Contractor activities (e.g., BRA compilation, H&S Plan, H&S File management, HIRAs, appointments, incidents). They must specify their accreditation level (None, Trainee, OHS Representative, SACPCMP Officer, SACPCMP Agent), with a registration number required for Officer/Agent roles.
3.2 Permissions & Access Control
(Updated to reflect collaboration and user independence)
The platform implements a role-based access control system:
Client: Can create projects, initiate BRAs, generate H&S Specifications, and approve H&S Plans. Clients can collaborate with Contractors and Agents on the same project.
Agent (PrCHSA): Inherits Client permissions for H&S management tasks (e.g., BRA, H&S Specification, H&S Plan approval).
Contractor (PC): Can create H&S Plans, manage H&S Files, appoint supervisors/CHSOs, conduct HIRAs, and view Client H&S Specifications.
Sub-contractor: Can create their own H&S Plan (for PC approval), manage their H&S File section, and view the Client’s H&S Specification (via PC). (Not fully implemented; planned for future updates.)
CHSO: Can update inspection registers and HIRAs within the PC’s project file but cannot approve the main H&S Plan.
Implementation Update: Users can compile documents without logging in, with temporary data storage for 7 days. Logged-in users can track projects persistently, enabling collaboration (e.g., Client initiates, Contractor populates, Agent reviews). All actions are user-driven to minimize admin intervention.
3.3 High-Level Workflow
(Updated to reflect collaboration and temporary data storage)
The platform guides users through a legally mandated sequence of H&S activities, now supporting collaboration and non-logged-in usage:
Initiation: Client creates a new project profile (or a non-logged-in user starts compiling documents).
Planning (Client): Client (or Agent) prepares the BRA and H&S Specification.
Appointment (Client): Client appoints the Principal Contractor, verifies competency and COIDA status, and signs a Section 37(2) Agreement.
Planning (PC): PC submits initial compliance documents (e.g., Letter of Good Standing) and prepares the H&S Plan.
Approval (Client): Client (or Agent) reviews and approves the PC’s H&S Plan before work commences.
Notification/Permit: PC notifies DoL (Annexure 1). Client/Agent applies for a DoL Permit (Annexure 2) if required.
Execution & Management (PC): PC establishes the H&S File, makes statutory appointments, manages sub-contractor compliance, and conducts HIRAs.
Ongoing Compliance (All Contractors): Perform inspections, inductions, toolbox talks, maintain training/medical records, and manage incidents.
Monitoring & Auditing: Client/Agent conducts periodic audits (at least monthly). PC audits sub-contractors.
Closeout: PC finalizes and hands over the H&S File to the Client.
Implementation Update:
Collaboration: Logged-in users (Clients, Contractors, Agents) can collaborate on the same project. For example, a Client initiates a project, the Contractor populates the H&S Plan, and the Agent reviews it.
Non-Logged-In Users: Can compile documents without logging in. Data is stored temporarily for 7 days with a reference number for retrieval. After 7 days, the data expires unless the user registers.
User Independence: All actions (e.g., project creation, document compilation, checkout) are user-driven, requiring no admin intervention.
