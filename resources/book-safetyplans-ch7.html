Testing and Review of the OHS Plan
Ensuring a safe and healthy work environment is a continuous commitment that goes beyond the initial development and implementation of an Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) plan. Regular testing and review of the OHS plan are essential components of this commitment, designed to evaluate the plan's effectiveness, relevance, and compliance with occupational health and safety standards.
The objective of this section is to guide organisations through the crucial processes of testing and reviewing their OHS plans. These processes are not only about compliance but also about proactively identifying and addressing potential weaknesses, gaps, and areas for improvement. By doing so, organisations can enhance their ability to prevent accidents, incidents, and injuries, thereby promoting a safe and healthy working environment for all employees.
We will explore the frequency and methods of testing and review, highlighting the importance of stakeholder input and the integration of insights from accidents and incidents. Practical case studies will be presented to illustrate effective testing and review practices in various organisational contexts, offering valuable insights, solutions, and best practices to enhance the effectiveness and compliance of the OHS management system.
By prioritising the testing and review of the OHS plan, organisations demonstrate their commitment to continuous improvement in occupational health and safety, fostering a culture of safety, responsibility, and well-being among employees.
Frequency of Testing and Review
The frequency of testing and reviewing the OHS plan should be determined based on the organisation's size, nature of operations, level of risks, and compliance requirements. Generally, the OHS plan should be tested and reviewed at least annually or following significant changes in the organisation's operations, processes, or legislation.
Establish a regular schedule for testing and reviewing the OHS plan, policies, procedures, and practices.
Conduct interim reviews and assessments following significant changes, incidents, accidents, or non-compliance issues to ensure continuous improvement and compliance.

Methods of Testing and Review
Various methods can be employed to test and review the OHS plan, including internal audits, external audits, inspections, observations, surveys, and consultations with stakeholders. 
Conduct internal audits and assessments by qualified and competent OHS professionals to evaluate the OHS plan's compliance, effectiveness, and performance.
Engage external auditors and certification bodies to conduct independent audits and assessments of the OHS management system against relevant legislation, regulations, and standards, such as ISO 45001.
Perform regular inspections and observations of the workplace, processes, activities, and equipment to identify potential risks, hazards, and non-compliance issues.
Collect feedback through surveys, consultations, and discussions with employees, management, trade unions, regulatory authorities, and other stakeholders to capture their input and insights on the OHS plan and its implementation.

Capture of Information from Accidents and Incidents
Accidents and incidents provide valuable information and insights that can inform and contribute to the testing and review process of the OHS plan, policies, procedures, and practices. 
To maximise on the insights of Accidents and Incidents: 

Develop and implement effective incident and accident reporting and investigation procedures to capture, analyse, and address information from accidents and incidents.
Evaluate the root causes, contributing factors, and lessons learned from accidents and incidents to identify potential weaknesses, gaps, and areas for improvement in the OHS plan and its implementation.
Integrate the findings, recommendations, and corrective actions from incident and accident investigations into the OHS plan to enhance its effectiveness, relevance, and compliance.

Integration of Stakeholder Input During Review
The input and feedback from various stakeholders, including employees, management, trade unions, regulatory authorities, and external partners, are crucial to ensuring a comprehensive and inclusive review of the OHS plan.
Doing this effectively involves:

Develop and implement effective mechanisms and channels to capture, collect, and integrate the input and feedback from stakeholders during the review of the OHS plan.
Facilitate consultations, discussions, and collaborations with stakeholders to gather their insights, perspectives, and recommendations on the OHS plan and its implementation.
Analyse and integrate the input and feedback from stakeholders to identify potential improvements, enhancements, and adjustments to the OHS plan, policies, procedures, and practices, ensuring a holistic and inclusive approach to OHS management and compliance.

Case Studies Illustrating the Testing and Review Process
Case studies can provide practical insights into the testing and review process of the OHS plan, highlighting the challenges faced, solutions implemented, lessons learned, and best practices adopted by organisations. 

Compile and analyse case studies illustrating the testing and review process of the OHS plan in various organisations, industries, and contexts.
Identify common challenges, issues, and trends in the testing and review of the OHS plan and share practical insights, solutions, and best practices to enhance the effectiveness and compliance of the OHS management system.
Here are two case studies showcasing effective testing and review practices:
Case Study 1: Manufacturing Company: A chemical spill resulted in employee exposure. The Review Process:
An internal investigation with all stakeholders including injured employee was done,
Conducted an internal audit to assess chemical handling procedures.
Engaged employees to share insights on safety practices.
Updated the spill response plan based on lessons learned.
Outcome: Improved chemical storage and handling protocols.
Case Study 2: Construction Project: A fall from height led to serious injuries. The Review Process:
Conducted an incident investigation led by an external audit by a safety consultant.
Stakeholder interviews (workers, supervisors, project managers).
Revised fall protection plan and provided additional training.
Outcome: Reduced fall-related incidents on subsequent projects.


Regular testing and reviewing of the OHS plan are vital for ensuring its effectiveness, relevance, and compliance with occupational health and safety standards. This continuous process identifies weaknesses, gaps, and areas for improvement, enhancing the organisation's ability to prevent accidents and promote a safe and healthy working environment.
The frequency of testing and review should be tailored to the organisation's size, nature of operations, and level of risks. Generally, an annual review is recommended, supplemented by interim reviews following significant changes, incidents, accidents, or non-compliance issues.
Various methods, including internal and external audits, inspections, observations, surveys, and stakeholder consultations, can be employed to assess the OHS plan comprehensively. These methods ensure compliance with relevant legislation, regulations, and standards and help in the continuous improvement of the OHS management system.
Accidents and incidents provide valuable learning opportunities. Effective incident and accident reporting and investigation procedures are essential to capture, analyse, and address information from these events. Integrating the findings and recommendations from incident and accident investigations into the OHS plan significantly enhances its effectiveness and relevance.
Stakeholder input is invaluable during the review process. By developing and implementing effective mechanisms to capture, collect, and integrate stakeholders' feedback, organisations can ensure a holistic and inclusive approach to OHS management and compliance.
Testing and reviewing the OHS plan are continuous and dynamic processes requiring dedication, commitment, and collaboration from all levels of the organisation. By prioritising these processes, organisations can ensure the ongoing improvement of their OHS management systems, fostering a safe, healthy, and productive working environment for all employees.
