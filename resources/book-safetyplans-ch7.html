Measuring Progress: Assessing Compliance with OHS Standards
An effective Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) plan is not merely a set of procedures but serves as a comprehensive roadmap for achieving and sustaining compliance with relevant legislation, international standards, and best practices. Regularly assessing compliance with OHS regulations, standards, and best practices is crucial for maintaining a robust safety culture and demonstrating an unwavering commitment to continuous improvement in workplace safety.
This chapter is designed to guide organisations & professionals through the process of evaluating their OHS plans against established benchmarks, identifying areas for improvement, and fostering a culture of accountability and transparency. We will also discuss the significance of staying updated on international best practices in OHS. By actively researching industry trends, benchmarking against leading organisations, and integrating emerging technologies, organisations can further enhance their OHS efforts and foster a culture that prioritises employee well-being.
By proactively assessing and measuring progress in compliance with OHS standards, organisations can minimise legal risks, build trust and confidence with stakeholders and regulators, and position themselves as leaders in workplace safety. This commitment not only safeguards employees but also contributes to improved morale, reduced absenteeism due to work-related injuries, and potentially lower insurance premiums.

Assessing Compliance with OHS Legislation
The foundation of any OHS management system lies in adherence to relevant legislation.  
Here's how to assess compliance:

Identify Applicable Legislation: Conduct a thorough review to determine all OHS legislation, regulations, and codes of practice applicable to your industry and operations. (e.g., OHS Act, Construction Regulations)
Gap Analysis: Compare your existing OHS plan and practices with the requirements outlined in the identified legislation. This helps pinpoint any gaps or areas where your plan falls short.  Conducting gap analyses at regular intervals ensures your OHS plan remains aligned with any changes or updates in legal requirements.
Taking Corrective Action:  Develop and implement corrective action plans to address identified gaps and ensure full compliance with legal requirements.  This may involve revising policies, procedures, or implementing new control measures to mitigate identified hazards.  Track the progress of corrective actions and ensure their effectiveness in achieving compliance.

By proactively assessing compliance with OHS legislation, you minimise legal risks and demonstrate a commitment to operating within the established legal framework.  This not only safeguards your employees but also fosters trust and confidence with stakeholders, regulators, and the wider community.

Assessing Compliance with OHS Standards (OHSAS 18000 & ISO 45001)
International OHS standards like OHSAS 18001 (now superseded by ISO 45001) provide a comprehensive framework for developing and implementing an effective OHS management system.  While achieving certification is not mandatory, it demonstrates a commitment to best practices:

Understanding the Standard:  Familiarise yourself with the key requirements of ISO 45001, which outlines a systematic approach to managing OHS risks and continually improving performance.  The standard emphasises leadership commitment, risk management, worker participation, and continual improvement.
Internal Audits: Conduct regular internal audits to assess your OHS management system against the requirements of ISO 45001, identifying areas for improvement.  Internal audits can be conducted by qualified internal personnel or external auditors.
Considering External Certification: While not mandatory, achieving ISO 45001 certification demonstrates your commitment to a robust OHS management system and can provide a competitive advantage. Certification bodies conduct a rigorous audit of your OHS practices to ensure compliance with the standard.  Maintaining certification requires ongoing commitment to continual improvement.

By aligning your OHS plan with international best practices embodied in standards like ISO 45001, you elevate your safety culture and showcase your dedication to employee well-being.  This can lead to improved employee morale, reduced absenteeism due to work-related injuries, and potentially lower insurance premiums.

International Best Practices in OHS
Beyond specific legislation and standards, staying abreast of international best practices in OHS is crucial:

Researching Industry Trends: Actively research and implement best practices specific to your industry sector. Industry associations and professional bodies often provide valuable resources and guidance on emerging safety trends and best practices.
Benchmarking: Benchmark your OHS performance against leading organisations in your industry to identify areas for improvement and learn from their successes. Benchmarking exercises can involve data analysis, site visits, or participation in industry forums.
Staying Updated: Continuously monitor and adapt your OHS plan in response to evolving best practices and emerging technologies in the field of occupational health and safety.  New technologies like wearable safety devices, real-time hazard monitoring systems, and virtual reality safety training can significantly enhance your OHS efforts.


Assessing compliance with OHS standards is a fundamental aspect of maintaining a robust safety culture and demonstrating an organisation's commitment to the well-being of its employees. Both organisations and professionals play a vital role in this process. By regularly evaluating your OHS plan against relevant legislation, such as the OHS Act and Construction Regulations, organisations and OHS professionals can identify and address potential gaps, thereby minimising legal risks and building trust with stakeholders and regulators.
Additionally, aligning your OHS plan with international standards like ISO 45001 at an international level or OHSAS 18000 in the case of South Africa not only elevates your safety culture but also offers a competitive advantage. Achieving external certification through rigorous audits further reinforces the dedication of both organisations and professionals to implementing and improving an effective OHS management system.
Moreover, staying abreast of international best practices in OHS is crucial for continuous improvement. Both organisations and OHS professionals must actively research industry trends, benchmark against leading organisations, and integrate emerging technologies to further enhance their OHS efforts and foster a culture that prioritises employee well-being.
In essence, a comprehensive compliance assessment program, led by both organisations and OHS professionals, fosters a culture of accountability and transparency. When coupled with continuous improvement initiatives, it can lead to improved employee morale, reduced absenteeism due to work-related injuries, and potentially lower insurance premiums. Therefore, investing in assessing and measuring progress in compliance with OHS standards is not only a legal and regulatory requirement but also a strategic imperative for organisations and professionals committed to excellence in workplace safety.
