From Environmental Health to Risk Management.
My journey began at Kiriyatswane Secondary School in Embalenhle township, where the scent from a nearby Sasol plant sparked my interest in health and safety.

Choosing Environmental Health: In 1999, I enrolled in Environmental Health at Pretoria Technikon (now Tshwane University of Technology) due to its diverse job opportunities and affordability. Despite my initial unemployment worries, I completed my National Diploma and gained practical experience in Namibia, becoming a Junior Environmental Health Practitioner in East London. However, resource constraints in government work led me to explore other avenues.

Venturing into Mining:  I joined a mining learnership at Anglo Platinum, excelling and becoming the top trainee. I focused on occupational hygiene, ensuring safety over production pressures and gaining valuable experience in diverse environments.

Career Expansion: I transitioned to Metrorail as an assistant risk manager, where I successfully prepared for a NOSA audit. Later, I managed emergency response planning and asbestos programs at Absa. Alongside, I consulted privately, adapting and honing skills across industries. My interests expanded to include cybersecurity, AI, and emerging technologies.

Reflection on Educational Choices: Reflecting on my journey, I realised the value of practical learning over traditional tertiary education. I could have earned an income while gaining hands-on experience through a training program, avoiding the burden of student debt.

Applying Principles to Personal Life: A career in health and safety also enhanced my personal growth, helping me apply risk management principles in various life situations, including during my Xhosa initiation into manhood.

Passion, Perseverance, and Commitment:  Despite the field's initial lack of prestige, my dedication and hard work opened doors to various interests. I emphasise that a university degree isn't essential; most of my knowledge came from practice. With passion and continuous learning, you can make a meaningful contribution to safety while achieving personal and professional fulfilment.

My career in health and safety has been profoundly rewarding, despite the challenges I faced along the way. The journey, from a scent in an industrial plant in highschool to leading roles in various sectors, proves that with passion and perseverance, one can thrive even in a country with high unemployment like South Africa. The field not only offers meaningful work but also the opportunity to make a significant impact on safety and well-being while achieving personal and professional fulfilment.
