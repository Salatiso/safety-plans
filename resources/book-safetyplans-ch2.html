Legal Framework and Compliance
Understanding the legal framework governing OHS plans is crucial for employers to ensure compliance and effectively manage workplace risks. The Occupational Health and Safety Act (OHSA) No. 85 of 1993 is the primary legislation in South Africa that governs OHS in workplaces. This chapter provides an in-depth analysis of the specific sections of the OHSA dealing with OHS plans and outlines the regulations explicitly requiring OHS plans.

OHS Plans under the Occupational Health and Safety Act (OHSA)
The Occupational Health and Safety Act (OHSA) No. 85 of 1993 forms the foundation for OHS management in South Africa across various sectors, excluding mining which is governed by the MHSA.  Below are the specific sections of the OHSA dealing with OHS plans:

Section 8, Duty to Provide and Maintain a Safe Working Environment: "Every employer shall provide and maintain, as far as is reasonably practicable, a working environment that is safe and without risk to the health of his employees."  Compliance to this section can be demonstrated with the development and implementation of an OHS Plan showing the employer has implemented measures to provide and maintain a safe working environment.
Section 9, Duties of Employers to Non-Employees:  "Every employer shall conduct his undertaking in such a manner as to ensure, as far as is reasonably practicable, that persons other than those in his employment who may be directly affected by his activities are not thereby exposed to hazards to their health or safety."  Employers must ensure that their OHS plan includes measures to protect non-employees, such as contractors, visitors, and the public, from workplace hazards.
Section 14, Duties of Employees: "Every employee shall at work—   (a) take reasonable care for the health and safety of himself and of other persons who may be affected by his acts or omissions;"   Employers must provide training and information to employees on their responsibilities for health and safety as part of the OHS plan.
Regulations of the Occupational Health and Safety Act Requiring OHS Plans
Several regulations under the OHSA require the development and implementation of OHS plans to manage and mitigate OHS Risks. This list is not comprehensive but below are the key regulations:

General Safety Regulations (GSR): Regulation 2 (1): "every employer and every user of machinery shall make an evaluation of the risk attached to any condition or situation which may arise from the activities of such employer or user, as the case may be, and to which persons at a workplace or in the course of their employment or in connection with the use of machinery are exposed, and he shall take such steps as may under the circumstances be necessary to make such condition or situation safe."
Asbestos Abatement Regulations:  Regulation 6: "asbestos -containing materials are identified, as required in regulation 3, the employer or self -employed person must ensure that a written asbestos management plan for the workplace is prepared by a competent p."  Employers must prepare a written asbestos management plan.
Construction Regulations:  
Regulation 5:  "A client must - (a) prepare a baseline risk assessment for an intended construction work project. (b) prepare a suitably, sufficiently documented and coherent site specific health and safety specification for the intended construction work based on the baseline risk assessment.
Regulation 7: “A principal contractor must - provide and demonstrate to the client a suitable, sufficiently documented and coherent site specific health and safety plan, based on the client’s documented health and safety specifications contemplated in regulation 5(1)(b), which plan must be applied from the date of commencement of and for the duration of the construction work and which must be viewed and updated by the principal contractor as work in progress”

OHS Plans under the Mine Health and Safety Act (MHSA)
The Mine Health and Safety Act (MHSA) No. 29 of 1996 serves as the cornerstone of occupational health and safety (OHS) legislation in the South African mining industry. 
The MHSA emphasises the importance of proactive safety measures through the following sections:

Section 2: This section places a duty on mine owners to ensure, as far as reasonably practicable, the health and safety of their employees. An OHS plan serves as a critical tool for fulfilling this duty by outlining a comprehensive strategy to identify, assess, and control workplace hazards.
Section 5: This section requires a Manager to maintain a healthy and safe mine environment.

Application of the Legal Framework Internationally
The principles and requirements outlined are consistent with international OHS standards and best practices. Employers worldwide can benefit from understanding and implementing similar legal requirements to ensure a safe and healthy working environment for all.
