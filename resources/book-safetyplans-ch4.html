Process Steps for Compilation of the OHS Plan
Developing a comprehensive OHS plan is the cornerstone of creating a safe and healthy work environment. This chapter guides you through the essential steps involved in compiling an effective OHS plan, equipping you to proactively manage workplace hazards and risks.

Legal Compliance Assessment
The journey begins with a thorough legal compliance assessment.  
Identifying all relevant OHS legislation, regulations, and standards applicable to your industry and operations. (e.g., OHS Act, Construction Regulations, Asbestos Regulations)
Examining your current practices and procedures to ensure compliance with these legal requirements.
Identifying any gaps or areas where your current practices need to be adjusted to achieve full legal compliance.
By conducting a comprehensive legal compliance assessment, you establish a solid foundation for your OHS plan, ensuring it aligns with all relevant legal obligations.

Baseline Risk Assessment
Once legal compliance is established, the next step is to conduct a comprehensive baseline risk assessment. 
Systematically identifying all potential hazards present in your workplace.
Analysing the likelihood and severity of potential harm associated with each hazard.
Evaluating the existing control measures in place to mitigate these risks.
Prioritising risks based on their severity and likelihood of occurrence.
The baseline risk assessment provides a clear picture of your workplace hazards and helps you prioritise areas where control measures need to be implemented or strengthened.

Health and Safety Policy Development
Based on the legal compliance assessment and baseline risk assessment, the organisation needs to develop a clear and comprehensive Health and Safety Policy. This policy should reflect the organisation's commitment to providing a safe and healthy working environment and comply with legal and regulatory requirements. 

Draft a Health and Safety Policy outlining the organisation's commitment, objectives, and strategies.
Review and finalise the Health and Safety Policy with input from key stakeholders, including the Board of Directors, senior management, and OHS professionals.
Communicate and distribute the Health and Safety Policy to all employees and stakeholders.

Implementation of Control Measures
Once the risks and hazards are identified and prioritised, the organisation needs to implement appropriate control measures to mitigate, reduce, or eliminate the identified risks and hazards.      

Develop and implement control measures, including engineering controls, administrative controls, and personal protective equipment (PPE).
Monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of the implemented control measures.
Review and adjust the control measures as necessary to ensure continuous improvement and compliance with OHS requirements.

Induction and Training Programs
Induction and training programs are essential to ensure that all employees understand and adhere to the organisation's Health and Safety Policy, procedures, and practices. 

Develop and implement an induction program for new employees, introducing them to the organisation's OHS policies, procedures, and practices.
Conduct regular OHS training programs for all employees, focusing on specific risks, hazards, and control measures relevant to their roles and responsibilities.
Monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of the induction and training programs and make necessary adjustments to enhance employee awareness and compliance.

Establishment of Health and Safety Committees
Establishing Health and Safety Committees is crucial to facilitate communication, collaboration, and consultation on OHS matters among employees, management, and other stakeholders. 

Formulate Health and Safety Committees comprising representatives from management, employees, and other stakeholders.
Define the roles, responsibilities, and functions of the Health and Safety Committees.
Conduct regular meetings and discussions to review OHS performance, address concerns, and implement improvements.

Development of Emergency Response Plans
Developing comprehensive Emergency Response Plans is essential to ensure preparedness and effective response to emergencies, incidents, and accidents within the organisation. 

Identify potential emergencies, incidents, and accidents based on the risk assessment.
Develop and implement Emergency Response Plans outlining the procedures, roles, responsibilities, and communication strategies during emergencies.
Conduct regular drills and exercises to test and evaluate the effectiveness of the Emergency Response Plans.

Construction Regulations Compliance
For organisations involved in construction activities, compliance with the Construction Regulations is crucial to ensure a safe and healthy working environment for all employees and stakeholders. 

Review and understand the Construction Regulations applicable to the organisation's activities.
Develop and implement specific OHS measures and control measures to comply with the Construction Regulations.
Monitor and evaluate compliance with the Construction Regulations and make necessary adjustments to enhance OHS performance and compliance.

Establishment of Internal OHS Department
Establishing an Internal OHS Department is essential to facilitate the development, implementation, monitoring, and review of the OHS plan, policies, procedures, and practices within the organisation. 

Formulate an Internal OHS Department comprising qualified and competent OHS professionals.
Define the roles, responsibilities, and functions of the Internal OHS Department.
Provide necessary resources, support, and training to the Internal OHS Department to enhance its effectiveness and efficiency.

Allocation of OHS Resources
Allocating adequate resources, including finances, personnel, and technologies, is crucial to support the development, implementation, and maintenance of effective OHS management systems and initiatives.

Identify and allocate necessary resources, including finances, personnel, and technologies, to support the OHS plan, policies, procedures, and practices.
Monitor and evaluate the utilisation of OHS resources and make necessary adjustments to enhance effectiveness and efficiency.
Ensure continuous investment in OHS resources to support the organisation's commitment to safety, compliance, and continuous improvement.

External Certification ISO 45001
Achieving external certification, such as ISO 45001, demonstrates the organisation's commitment to implementing and maintaining a comprehensive and effective OHS management system. 

Prepare and align the OHS management system with the requirements of ISO 45001.
Conduct internal audits and assessments to evaluate the OHS management system's compliance and readiness for external certification.
Engage an accredited certification body to conduct an external audit and assess the organisation's OHS management system against the ISO 45001 requirements.
Address any identified non-conformities and implement necessary improvements to achieve and maintain ISO 45001 certification.
