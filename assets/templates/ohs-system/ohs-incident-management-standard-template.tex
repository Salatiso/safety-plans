\section{OHS Incident Management Process}

\subsection{Immediate Response to an Incident}
Ensure safety by providing first aid, making the area safe, and preserving evidence without disturbing the scene unless necessary.

\subsection{Incident Reporting (Internal)}
All incidents must be reported verbally immediately and documented in writing within 24 hours using the Internal OHS Incident Report Form.

\subsection{Incident Classification and Initial Assessment}
The OHS Manager shall classify the incident, determine statutory reporting requirements, and decide the level of investigation needed.

\subsection{Incident Recording}
Incidents shall be logged in the OHS Incident Register and recorded in Annexure 1 format for reportable incidents.

\subsection{Incident Investigation}
Investigations shall identify root causes using RCA techniques, involving a team including supervisors, H\&S representatives, and investigators.

\subsection{Corrective and Preventive Actions (CAPA)}
Develop and implement a CAP to address root causes, assign responsibilities, verify effectiveness, and communicate lessons learned.

\subsection{Statutory Reporting and Notification (External)}
Report incidents to the Department of Employment and Labour (DoEL) and Compensation Commissioner as required by law, using forms like WCL1/WCL2.

\subsection{Incident Data Analysis and Review}
Analyze incident trends periodically and review findings in management and H\&S committee meetings.

\subsection{Learning from Incidents and Continual Improvement}
Share lessons learned through safety alerts and update procedures and risk assessments as needed.

\section{Training for Incident Management}
Provide awareness training for employees on reporting procedures and specific training for investigators on RCA and reporting.

\section{Standard Review}
This standard will be reviewed at least every two years or as necessitated by changes in legislation, operations, or incident trends.
