\section{Introduction}
This Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) Control Measures Management Standard provides the operational framework for implementing the {{COMPANY_NAME}} OHS Control Measures Management Policy. It details processes for selecting, implementing, monitoring, and maintaining OHS control measures across the hierarchy of controls, with a comprehensive focus on PPE management.

\section{Purpose}
The purpose of this standard is to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Define procedures for applying the hierarchy of controls to mitigate OHS risks.
    \item Ensure control measures are implemented as far as reasonably practicable.
    \item Provide detailed processes for PPE management, including selection and maintenance.
    \item Support compliance with legal and SANS 45001 requirements.
    \item Promote continual improvement in OHS control measures.
\end{itemize}

\section{Scope}
This standard applies to all OHS control measures implemented across {{COMPANY_NAME}}’s operations in South Africa.

\section{Definitions}
Refer to the {{COMPANY_NAME}} OHS Control Measures Management Policy for key definitions. Additional definitions include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Engineering Controls:} Physical changes to equipment or processes to reduce risk (e.g., machine guards).
    \item \textbf{Administrative Controls:} Policies or procedures to reduce risk (e.g., safe work procedures).
\end{itemize}

\section{Legal and Standard References}
This standard is guided by:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Occupational Health and Safety Act 85 of 1993 (Sections 8, 1).
    \item General Safety Regulations (GSR 2).
    \item SANS 45001: Occupational Health and Safety Management Systems (Clause 8.1.2).
\end{itemize}

\section{OHS Control Measures Management Process}

\subsection{Risk Assessment and Control Selection}
Control measures shall be selected based on risk assessments (HIRA), following the hierarchy:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Elimination:} Remove the hazard entirely (e.g., discontinue a hazardous process).
    \item \textbf{Engineering Controls:} Isolate or reduce exposure (e.g., ventilation systems, guards).
    \item \textbf{Administrative Controls:} Implement procedures (e.g., training, SWPs, signage).
    \item \textbf{PPE:} Use protective equipment as a last resort (e.g., helmets, gloves).
    \item \textbf{Combinations:} Use multiple controls when necessary (e.g., PPE + SWPs).
\end{itemize}
Selection shall consider the “reasonably practicable” provision, balancing risk reduction with feasibility.

\subsection{Implementation of Control Measures}
Line Managers shall ensure control measures are implemented, documented, and communicated to relevant personnel.

\subsection{PPE Management}
PPE shall be managed comprehensively:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Selection:} Based on risk assessments and GSR 2 requirements.
    \item \textbf{Issuance:} Recorded in a PPE Issuance Register.
    \item \textbf{Training:} Employees trained on proper use and maintenance.
    \item \textbf{Inspection:} Regular checks to ensure PPE is fit for purpose.
    \item \textbf{Replacement:} Damaged or expired PPE replaced promptly.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Monitoring and Maintenance}
Control measures shall be monitored through inspections and audits. Engineering controls and PPE shall be maintained per manufacturer guidelines.

\subsection{Review and Improvement}
Control measures shall be reviewed annually or after incidents to ensure effectiveness and updated as needed.

\section{Record Keeping}
Maintain records of control measure implementation, PPE issuance, inspections, and reviews for at least 5 years.

\section{Standard Review}
This standard will be reviewed at least every two years or as necessitated by changes in legislation, operations, or risk profiles.
