\section{Purpose}
The purpose of this Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) Control Measures Management Policy is to affirm {{COMPANY_NAME}}'s commitment to implementing effective OHS control measures following the hierarchy of controls (elimination, engineering, administrative, PPE, and combinations) to mitigate workplace risks. This policy prioritizes higher-level controls where reasonably practicable, while ensuring comprehensive management of all controls, including PPE, to protect employees and others.

    \item \textbf{Reasonably Practicable:} A balance of risk reduction against cost, time, and effort, as per the OHS Act Section 1.
    \item \textbf{PPE (Personal Protective Equipment):} Equipment worn to minimize exposure to hazards (e.g., helmets, gloves).
